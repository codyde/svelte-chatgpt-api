# Basic SPA for interacting with the ChatGPT API 

More detailed readme to follow - but this was my first run at a Svelte app from scratch using Sveltekit.

In order for this to work, you'll need to export your OpenAI API key: 

```bash
export VITE_OPENAPI_SDK_KEY=<your-api-key>
```

If you're using this in Netlify/Vercel - add that as an environment variable.
